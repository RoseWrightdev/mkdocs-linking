# **feat: Implement MkDocs Migration Helper**

## **Summary**

This pull request introduces a robust tooling solution to facilitate large-scale documentation refactoring within MkDocs. It directly addresses the challenge of maintaining link integrity during reorganization.

The implementation provides a command-line utility and an automated build hook that work together to assign permanent IDs to documents, generate 301 redirects for moved files, and convert fragile relative links into a resilient, future-proof macro format.

This tool serves as the technical foundation for the documentation migration outlined in the [accompanying proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/3860), making a safe and efficient refactor achievable.

## **The Problem**

When restructuring a documentation site, manually updating hundreds of internal links and creating redirects is not only tedious but also highly error-prone. This process often leads to:

* **Broken Internal Links**: Resulting in a fragmented user experience.  
* **Loss of SEO Rank**: Caused by failing to redirect old URLs.  
* **Increased Maintenance Burden**: Making future reorganizations even more daunting.

## **The Solution**

This implementation provides a complete, automated workflow that solves these problems through a powerful command-line script (linking.py) and a seamless build-time integration (main.py).

### **Key Features & Workflow**

The workflow is broken down into three simple, powerful commands:

#### **1\. Prepare (\--prepare)**

Assigns a unique, permanent ID to every Markdown file and creates a redirect\_map.json to snapshot the site's initial structure.

python linking.py \--prepare

#### **2\. Convert Links (\--convert-links)**

Scans all documents and replaces fragile relative links with a resilient, ID-based macro that is immune to future file moves.

python linking.py \--convert-links

Before: \[My Link\](../../section/another-page.md)  
After: {{ internal\_link('another-page-id') }}

#### **3\. Build (mkdocs build)**

During the build, the on\_files hook automatically compares the new file structure to the original map and injects all necessary 301 redirect rules directly into your mkdocs.yml configuration. No manual updates are needed.

## **What's Included**

### **Code**

* linking.py: The core CLI tool for preparing files, converting links, and generating redirects via the MkDocs hook.  
* main.py: Provides the internal\_link macro functionality to the mkdocs-macros plugin.

### **Testing**

The implementation is supported by a comprehensive suite of **seven test files** that cover:

* Core migration and link conversion functionality.  
* CLI argument parsing and execution.  
* Robustness against edge cases like filesystem differences, link breakage scenarios, and malformed YAML frontmatter.

### **Documentation**

* README.md: Updated with detailed installation instructions and a clear usage guide.

## **How to Use**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  
   pip install mkdocs-redirects mkdocs-macros-plugin

2. **Configure mkdocs.yml:**  
   plugins:  
     \- redirects  
     \- macros:  
         module\_name: main

   hooks:  
     \- linking.py

3. **Run the Migration Workflow:**  
   \# Step 1: Prepare files with unique IDs  
   python linking.py \--prepare

   \# Step 2: Convert all relative links to the resilient macro format  
   python linking.py \--convert-links

   \# Step 3: Manually move and reorganize files as needed  
   git mv docs/old-path/doc.md docs/new-path/doc.md

   \# Step 4: Build the site. Redirects are generated automatically.  
   mkdocs build
